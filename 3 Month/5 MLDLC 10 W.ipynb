    "MLDLC (Machine Learning Development Life Cycle) refers to a structured approach for solving problems using machine learning. It involves a series of stages to develop, deploy, and optimize machine learning models effectively. The primary steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Understanding**: Identifying the business problem and determining how machine learning can address it.\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from various sources, which may include web scraping, APIs, or databases.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and scaling or normalizing features.\n",
    "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing data to understand key patterns and relationships.\n",
    "5. **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Creating new features or selecting the most relevant ones to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "6. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Applying machine learning algorithms, training models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.\n",
    "7. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Heroku for real-world use.\n",
    "8. **Testing**: Testing the model on real-world data to ensure its effectiveness in solving the target problem.\n",
    "9. **Optimization**: Iteratively tuning and improving the model based on feedback from testing and performance evaluations.\n",
    "\n",

It consists of six stages: concept development, design, material collection, assembly, testing, and distribution. This cycle is useful in fields like education, particularly in creating multimedia learning materials [Atlantis Press](https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/ictvet-18/55913962) [DEV Community](https://dev.to/rishabh055/machine-learning-development-life-cycle-mldlcmldc-423l)."
