    "### **1. Introduction to Framing the Problem (0:00 - 2:24)**\n",
    "In this section, introduce the concept of framing a machine learning problem. Explain that framing the problem properly is the most critical step in developing a machine learning solution. The objective here is to:\n",
    "- Understand the business goals.\n",
    "- Define how machine learning can address the issue.\n",
    "- Translate the problem into a solvable ML task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway: Before jumping into algorithms or data, the problem needs to be clearly defined and well-understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Case Study Example of Netflix for Churn Rate (2:24 - 6:23)**\n",
    "Discuss how Netflix uses machine learning to predict customer churn. Churn rate refers to the percentage of customers leaving a service over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Netflix wants to identify which users are likely to unsubscribe.\n",
    "- **Data**: Netflix can leverage user behavior data such as watch history, subscription duration, and customer interactions.\n",
    "- **Goal**: Build a model that predicts the likelihood of a user unsubscribing in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this case study to show how understanding the business problem (retaining customers) leads to an ML task (predicting churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. From Business Problem to Machine Learning Problem (6:23 - 7:08)**\n",
    "Describe how to convert the business problem into a well-defined ML task. For example, predicting churn can be defined as:\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning** task.\n",
    "- **Binary Classification** problem (churn or no churn).\n",
    "- **Input**: User behavior data, demographic data, etc.\n",
    "- **Output**: Probability or label (1: churn, 0: no churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step clarifies how to structure the data and what kind of prediction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Types of Problems (7:08 - 12:24)**\n",
    "Explain the different types of machine learning problems, and where the current problem fits:\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predict discrete categories (e.g., churn or not churn).\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., predicting sales).\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Group data points without labels (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from interaction with the environment (e.g., game playing).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Netflix case, itâ€™s a **binary classification problem** where the model needs to classify customers into one of two categories: \"churn\" or \"no churn.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Current Solution (12:24 - 13:33)**\n",
    "Discuss what solutions the company may already have in place. For instance, in Netflix's case:\n",
    "- **Current solution**: They may have a rule-based system that segments users based on past behavior.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: These methods might not capture complex patterns and interactions within data, motivating the need for a machine learning-based solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Getting Data (13:33 - 15:09)**\n",
    "Focus on how to acquire the data needed to solve the problem. Key points include:\n",
    "- **Source**: Where is the data coming from? (e.g., user behavior logs, interaction history, customer feedback).\n",
    "- **Types**: Numerical, categorical, text data, etc.\n",
    "- **Cleaning**: Ensure data quality, handle missing values, and remove outliers.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Create useful features from raw data that better represent the problem (e.g., recency, frequency of user activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Metrics to Measure (15:09 - 17:15)**\n",
    "Define the performance metrics that are relevant to the problem:\n",
    "- For churn prediction (classification), metrics might include:\n",
    "  - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted churn.\n",
    "  - **Precision/Recall**: Useful when dealing with class imbalances (focusing on churners).\n",
    "  - **F1 Score**: A balance of precision and recall.\n",
    "  - **AUC-ROC**: Evaluates the trade-off between true positives and false positives.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Choosing the right metric is critical for guiding model optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Online vs. Batch Learning (17:15 - 19:15)**\n",
    "Determine whether the machine learning model will be trained in:\n",
    "- **Batch Mode**: Train the model on the entire dataset periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly).\n",
    "- **Online Mode**: Continuously update the model as new data comes in (e.g., real-time churn predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix may prefer **batch learning** to update models periodically, or **online learning** for real-time predictions of churners based on the latest user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Check Assumptions (19:15 - End)**\n",
    "Finally, validate the assumptions made throughout the process. Some common assumptions include:\n",
    "- **Data Assumptions**: Are the input features accurate and relevant for the prediction task? Do they represent the problem well?\n",
    "- **Model Assumptions**: Are certain features more important than others? Does the model generalize well to new data?\n",
    "- **Business Assumptions**: Will solving this problem bring significant value? Are the costs of misclassification acceptable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking assumptions helps ensure that the problem has been framed realistically and that the solution will provide value when implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This outline provides a systematic approach to framing a machine learning problem, ensuring that all critical aspects (from problem definition to data, metrics, and assumptions) are considered before diving into model building."
